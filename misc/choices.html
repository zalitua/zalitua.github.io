<center><h1>Choices in Development of SLT Technology</h1></center>


<h4><p>Sign Language Technology (SLT) development must acknowledge the complexity of all 300 sign 
  languages and ought to benefit Deaf culture and their community. <p></h4>

<p>According to Zheng et at. (2021), Sign Language (SL) has its own language structure and, 
  therefore, cannot be directly translated word-for-word into spoken language. For many SL 
  speakers, spoken language is a second or third language. This presents a barrier because SL 
  speakers may not understand the structure of spoken or written language when communication is 
  needed most. </p>

<h4><p>Two main Sign Language Recognition (SLR) methods are available: 
    <br>•	Data glove-based  
    <br>•	Vision-based</p></h4>

<h4><p>Data glove-based</p></h4>

<p>Yang & Zhu (2019) state that early image processing speeds were limited by computational power; 
  therefore, data glove-based SLR was used. The accuracy of commercial gloves is highly dependent 
  on the glove’s fit to the user’s hand. Hand sizes vary hugely amongst signers based on gender, 
  age, and genetic factors. However, most commercial gloves are only available in one size. 
  Commercial gloves are bulky and inconvenient to carry around, which affects the experience of 
  Human-Computer Interaction.</p>

<p>CyberGlove was designed explicitly for ASL recognition. Two models of CyberGlove are available. 
  One model is equipped with 18 resistive bend sensors, and the other with 22 resistive bend 
  sensors to measure finger and wrist motions. Both models have four finger abduction sensors and 
  sensors measuring palm arch, wrist flexion, and wrist abduction. The main disadvantage of the 
  CyberGlove method is cost; a single glove ranges from $13,000 to $18,000 (USD), depending on the 
  model. Since SL relies on visible cues from hands, eyes, body movement and facial expressions to 
  communicate, Data glove-based SLR is not the best option in SLT because it is not easy to 
  distinguish between signs.</p>
