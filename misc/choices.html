<center><h1>Choices in Development of SLT Technology</h1></center>


<h4><p>There a lot of considerations to be made in development of technology for SLT. Broadly these can be 
  categorized as cost of development, profitability or value to the developer, accessibility to those that 
  need the technology and cost to the end user.<p></h4>
