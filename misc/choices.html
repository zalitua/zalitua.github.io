<center><h1>Choices in Development of SLT Technology</h1></center>


<h4><p>Sign Language Technology (SLT) development must acknowledge the complexity of all 300 sign 
  languages and ought to benefit Deaf culture and their community. <p></h4>

    <p>According to Zheng et at. (2021), Sign Language (SL) has its own language structure and, 
  therefore, cannot be directly translated word-for-word into spoken language. For many SL 
  speakers, spoken language is a second or third language. This presents a barrier because SL 
  speakers may not understand the structure of spoken or written language when communication is 
  needed most. </p>

  <h4><p>Two main Sign Language Recognition (SLR) methods are available: 
    •	Data glove-based  
    •	Vision-based</p></h4>
