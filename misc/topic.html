<center><h1>Technology for NZSL Translation</h1></center>
<h3><p>The WHO estimated that 360 million people worldwide have disabling hearing loss. </p></h3>
<h4><p>Utilising technology and AI to interpret and translate New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) in real-time
   through a smartphone/watch app.</p></h4>

<p>NZSL is one of three of New Zealand’s official languages and is crucial to many people's ability to 
  learn, communicate and participate in society.  There are approximately 4,599 deaf people who use NZSL 
  as a form of communication, and approximately 23,000 people in total use NZSL. This technology will help 
  with their ability to connect with society. It will help bridge the gap between those who use NZSL due to 
  impaired hearing or verbal ability and the general population who don’t understand NZSL. I am hard of 
  hearing myself and know that inclusive design should always be considered when designing a product. </p>
<p>Bridging the communication barrier allows the person who uses NZSL to feel like they aren’t left out. 
  Businesses can become more inclusive and provide a more comprehensive service to their customers.</p>
